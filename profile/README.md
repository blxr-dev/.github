## 🌐 What is BLXR?

BLXR is a modern, developer-focused ecosystem designed to make building software feel natural, expressive, and beautifully simple.  
At its core, BLXR introduces **.blx**, a new UI component language that compiles into high-performance React/TSX — paired with an English-like styling system and a growing suite of developer tools.

BLXR aims to simplify full-stack development without sacrificing power, performance, or flexibility.
